# TODO(pierewoj): Remove this file once all storage tests are migrated to a single suite.
# This is used for the storage tests migration from separate jobs to a single suite.
# Old storage tests won't have this override applied, so metric file names will
# remain the same.
# New tests will use this override, so the metric file name will be only parametrized
# by the suite test identifier.
TEST_NAME: ''
